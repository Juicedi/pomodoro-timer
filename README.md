# Pomodoro timer

This timer will count down from 25 mins of work and then gives option to have
5 - 10 min break. After the break the next 25 min work timer starts.

## TODOS:
 * Add a progress bar for the timer for better visibility.
   * Handles changing window size?
   * Full terminal window length
     * Needs current progress and max progress
     * Calculates how many blocks should be painted
