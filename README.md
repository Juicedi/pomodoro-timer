# Pomodoro timer

This timer will count down from 25 mins of work and then gives option to have
5 - 10 min break. After the break the next 25 min work timer starts.

## TODOS:
  * Check if the progress bar thinks the "[" and "]" are part of the progress
    bar
  * Check if flickering has been fixed by using setCursorPos(0, 0)
